## Who is Transit Future?

The Chicago-based not-for-profit Active Transportation Alliance is co-leading the campaign. Active Transportation Alliance's mission is to make bicycling, walking and public transit so safe, convenient and fun that we will achieve a significant shift from environmentally harmful, sedentary travel to clean, active travel. We advocate for transportation that encourages and promotes safety, physical activity, health, recreation, social interaction, equity, environmental stewardship and resource conservation.
