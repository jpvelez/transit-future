## In 2008, LA County voters had grown tired of the daily traffic jams, and knew that they needed a new way to get around. 

## So 68% of LA County voters chose to double the size of their transit system. It cost $40 billion, and they paid for it with a Â½-penny sales tax.

## Here in Cook County, we don't have to choose sales tax. But we can do something similar.
