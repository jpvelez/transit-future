## Arterial Rapid Transit (ART) Lines will bring speedy, frequent bus service to major streets. 

## They have new, high-speed buses, special stations, and can turn the stoplights green.

## Unlike BRT, they don't have dedicated road lanes.

## But they can jump ahead of traffic jams at major intersections.
