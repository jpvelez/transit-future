<h2 id='how_funding_works'>How funding works</h2>

<p>The Cook County Board of Commissioners can create that funding stream. Over the next several months, commissioners will work with Cook County residents to decide what kind of stream they will use.</p>

<p>Their options range from sales tax to parking fees to motor fuel taxes to property taxes. Transit Future is a campaign that aims to support the Commissioners in making the right choice and funding the new transit network.</p>

<p><strong>Join the campaign.</strong> Together we can build our transit future.</p>
