			<h2>Open Data and City Procurement</h2>
			<p>The City will work to develop contract provisions that promote open data in procurements that contain data systems, such as the City's Divvy bike share system. These provisions will promote the City's open data policies, and, where appropriate, require that data be posted on <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org">data.cityofchicago.org</a>.</p>
			<h2>Publishing Most Frequent FOIA Requests</h2>
			<p>Chicago will use text mining techniques to analyze Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to identify frequently-requested datasets and post them to the data portal. In addition to making popular data available to the public, this approach may also reduce FOIA requests. As an example of the success of this approach, in the 9 months after releasing environmental records, the Department of Public Health (CDPH) experienced a 65% drop in the number of FOIA requests for environmental records.</p>
			<h2>Improve City-County Coordination</h2>
			<p>The City and County will work together to streamline the public's access to City and County data and identify opportunities to coordinate more closely in the release of related datasets.</p>
			<h2>Dataset Requests</h2>
			<p>The City will create a new portal to allow residents to make requests for datasets to be made public. Residents will be able to continue requesting datasets by e-mailing <a href="mailto:dataportal@cityofchicago.org">dataportal@cityofchicago.org</a> or tweeting to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChicagoCDO">@ChicagoCDO</a>.</p>
			<h2>Open Data Status Blog</h2>
			<p>The City of Chicago will launch a new blog to provide updates on the data portal. In addition to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ChicagoCDO">@ChicagoCDO</a>, the portal will record and archive changes to datasets, explanations of outages, and responses to frequent questions.</p>
