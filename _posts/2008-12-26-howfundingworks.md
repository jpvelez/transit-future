## How funding works

Cook County can choose between sales, motor fuel and property taxes, as well as parking or development fees. 

Over the next several months, the County will work with local residents to decide what kind of tax they might use.

Transit Future recommends that the county choose a tax that hurts our wallets the least while giving the most power to build new transit lines.
