## West Loop Transportation Center

**The region's new transit hub.**

**One central station for the L, commuter rail, Amtrak, and, someday, high-speed rail.**

## Orange Line Extension

**Extending the Orange Line to Ford City Mall and Richard J. Daley College means shops, jobs and classrooms are just an L stop away.**

## Road projects

**These projects will make bridges and tunnels for freight trains where they cross over the street.**

**That means you don't have to wait in traffic for the train to pass.**

 **63rd/Harlem bridge or tunnel**

 **Central/54th Ave bridge or tunnel**

 **Columbus/Maplewood Ave bridge or tunnel**

 **Archer/Kenton Ave bridge or tunnel**

 **87th/Rockwell bridge or tunnel**

 **95th/Eggleston bridge or tunnel**

 **Pershing/Morgan bridge or tunnel**
